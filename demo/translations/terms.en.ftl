headline = Fluent: Terms
preamble = Text content tends to have quite a lot of repetitions. These can lead to copy & paste mistakes
  and code that needs to be adjusted via a full text search. Terms present a solution to this problem.
  In essence, terms are just your normal key value pairs, but with a twist. They can be included in other
  translations and will be inlined at compile time.

syntaxHeadline = Syntax
syntaxBody = Terms are key value pairs whose key begins with a dash "-". In this example, <code>-email</code>
  is a term while the other pairs are normal messages. 

fluentOnlyHeadline = Fluent only
fluentOnlyBody = Note that this feature is only supported in the <code>.ftl</code> file format, just like the next couple of
  features marked with the <code>Fluent:</code> prefix.
